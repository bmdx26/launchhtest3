        being a stupid 19yr old college student who fucking hates engineering , the 'founder'-bmd (thats my alias incase youre wondering) decided to build a project
        <br><br>
        being the stupid he is , he could'nt even come up with an idea
        <br><br>
        during his long pursuit scavenging through the internet (checking reddit and twitter ) , he realized that there are people with ideas who needed help in developing them
        <br><br>
        but arent there platforms for this already ?? 
        <br><br>
        (didn't you read the second sentence? he couldn't come up with new ideas. ) 
        <br><br>
        he didn't try to reinvent the wheel , he just developed whatever came to his mind
        <br><br>
        so , even if ur a brand or a solopreneur or just another kid with an idea , hit us up
        <br><br>
        or if you want something like an app or a website or design built , schedule a call
