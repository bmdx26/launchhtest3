        The entire concept of Launchh.it was simple—simple in the sense that it was relatable for me. I ain't someone who got innovative ideas, 
        life-changing concepts, or anything. But I did want to develop something mainly because engineering was boring—well, boring for me at least.
        <br>
        Building a project does take a lot of steps. So if I can't discover ideas, I could help others in need develop their ideas, right?
        <br>
        And what if there was a community for students, solopreneurs, and even brands such that their ideas can be built in a flexible manner? Apps, websites, platforms, brands—anything can be built with the help of people from all around the world!
        <br>
        It doesn't matter if you're a student, an employee, an entrepreneur, or a brand. If you got an idea and you need help to develop it, we're here.
