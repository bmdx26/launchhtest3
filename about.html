        the entire concept of Launchh was simple—simple in the sense that it was relatable for me. i ain't someone who got innovative ideas, 
        life-changing concepts, or anything. but I did want to develop something mainly because engineering was boring—well, boring for me at least.

        building a project does take a lot of steps. so if I can't discover ideas, I could help others in need develop their ideas, right?
        <br>
